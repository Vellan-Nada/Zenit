      <h1>Terms of Service</h1>

      <section id="introduction">
        <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
        <p>
          These Terms of Service ("Terms") are a binding agreement between you
          and ZENIT ONLINE (doing business as Zenit) ("Zenit", "we", "us" or
          “our”). They govern your access to and use of Zenit's websites, and
          services (the "Services"). By using the Services, you agree to these
          Terms and our Privacy Policy. If you do not agree, do not use the
          Services.
        </p>
        <p>
          You must be at least 18 years old to use the Services. If you use the
          Services on behalf of an organization, you represent that you have
          authority to bind that organization and that "you" includes the
          organization.
        </p>

      <section id="changes">
        <p><strong>Changes</strong></p>

          We may update these Terms from time to time. If changes are material,
          we will provide reasonable notice (for example, via the website,
          email, or this page). The updated Terms will be effective on the
          stated date. Your continued use after the effective date constitutes
          acceptance.

          <li>

      <section id="paid-features">
        <p><strong>Paid Features and Billing</strong></p>
        <p>
          Some features require a paid subscription. Prices, billing cycles, and
          applicable taxes are shown at checkout. If you enroll in a
          subscription, it auto-renews at the then-current price unless you
          cancel before the renewal date via your account or platform settings.
        </p>
        <p>
          Payments are processed by our payment partner (Stripe); we do not
          store full payment card details. Subject to applicable law, fees are
          non-refundable except where we are legally required to provide a
          refund.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="termination">
        <p><strong>Termination</strong></p>
        <p>
          You may stop using the Services at any time. We may suspend or
          terminate access if you violate these Terms, if needed to protect the
          Services or other users, or where required by law. Upon termination,
          your right to use the Services ends, but provisions intended to
          survive (including ownership, disclaimers, limitations of liability,
          and governing law) will continue.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="disclaimers">
        <p><strong>Disclaimers and Limits</strong></p>
        <p>
          The Services are provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis,
          without warranties of any kind, whether express or implied. We do not
          warrant that the Services will be uninterrupted or error-free.
        </p>
        <p>
          To the maximum extent permitted by law, neither Zenit nor its
          affiliates will be liable for any indirect, incidental, special,
          consequential, exemplary, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits,
          revenues, data, or goodwill, arising out of or related to your use of
          the Services. Our total liability for all claims in any 12-month
          period will not exceed the amounts you paid to Zenit for the Services
          in that period.
        </p>

      <section id="governing-law">
        <p><strong>Governing Law and Venue</strong></p>

          These Terms are governed by the laws of Malaysia, without regard to
          conflict of law principles. You and Zenit submit to the exclusive
